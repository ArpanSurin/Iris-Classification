# IRIS CLASSIFICATION 
This project is a part of my Internship training program at **Bharat Intern**

 Develop a ML Model for classifying iris flowers based on their features using Python, scikit-learn. 

## Dataset Information
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:
* Id
* SepalLengthCm
* SepalWidthCm
* PetalLengthCm
* PetalWidthCm
* Species
* Sepal Width vs. Sepal Length

## Algorithms
* Logistic Regression
* K Neihbors Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier

**Best Model Accuracy : 86.66**
